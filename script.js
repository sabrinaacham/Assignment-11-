//For this assignment we will create a web page which works like the popular Mad Libs game.
//HTML and CSS code is provided for the game 'Talk Like a Pirate' (web site, code) and you are required to write JavaScript which will insert words into the HTML using DOM manipulation.
//The game has six types of word classes defined including those for 'noun', 'adjective', 'verb', 'adverb', 'plural-noun' and 'body-part'.
//Part 1: Create arrays of 10 words each for the six classes outlined. Use a DOM query to return a list of elements based on the class names provided.
//For each of the NodeLists returned, loop through the list and replace the text content with the matching type from the arrays you created
